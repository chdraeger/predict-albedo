# Train neural network to predict mountain glacier albedo, trained on MODIS albedo data

Code for the albedo prediction in the study of Draeger et al. (2024), *Assessing the impact of calibration and albedo models on regional glacier modeling with surface energy balance in southwestern Canada*

Below is a short guide to the data used, and for reproducing the training and testing.

## Data
MODIS albedo and meteorological and topographic data.
Shape constants for the input data are defined in `CONSTANTS.py`.
